# Cloud Engineer/DevOps Challenge

The individual points should be treated as guidelines. Feel free to adopt a different approach if you deem it more
suitable.

1. **Dockerization of Application**: You will find a sample-frontend and a sample-backend folder. Your task is to
   Dockerize the entire application, ensuring that the frontend and backend can effectively communicate with each other.

2. **CI/CD Concept Creation**: create a CI/CD concept for the entire application so frontend and backend can be deployed
   in multiple environments stages

3. **Advanced Material Property**: The `fooness.py` file contains a function that is a placeholder for a potential
   long-running computation. Create a
   concept outlining how a service can be provided to customers for calculating this property for a given material.

4. **Evaluation and Improvement**: Evaluate the application's security, scalability, availability, reliability,
   performance, and cost. Develop a concept for potential improvements in these areas, if deemed necessary.
